Imports

Here’s what each import at the top of your file does:

```python
import copy
```

- **Purpose:** Provides functions for copying objects.
- **Usage:** `copy.deepcopy()` is used to create a deep copy of the chess board for move validation (so the original board isn’t changed).

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional, Dict
```

- **Purpose:** Provides type hints for better code clarity and static analysis.
  - `List`: Used for lists (e.g., `List[Move]`).
  - `Tuple`: Used for tuples (e.g., board positions like `(row, col)`).
  - `Optional`: Indicates a value can be of a type or `None` (e.g., `Optional[Piece]`).
  - `Dict`: Used for dictionaries (not heavily used in this excerpt, but available).

```python
from enum import Enum
```

- **Purpose:** Allows creation of enumerations (enums), which are used for `PieceType` and `Color` to represent chess piece types and colors in a clear, type-safe way.

The `PieceType` class is an enumeration (`Enum`) that defines the different types of chess pieces. Each member of the enum represents a specific piece and is associated with a single-character string (commonly used in chess notation):

```python
class PieceType(Enum):
    PAWN = 'p'
    ROOK = 'r'
    KNIGHT = 'n'
    BISHOP = 'b'
    QUEEN = 'q'
    KING = 'k'
```

**Purpose:**

- To provide a clear, type-safe way to refer to chess piece types throughout the code.
- The values (`'p'`, `'r'`, etc.) are used for display, notation, and logic.

**Usage Example:**

- When creating a piece: `Piece(PieceType.KNIGHT, Color.WHITE)`
- When checking a piece's type: `if piece.type == PieceType.QUEEN: ...`

This makes the code more readable and less error-prone than using plain strings or numbers.

The `Color` class is an enumeration (`Enum`) that defines the two possible colors for chess pieces and players:

```python
class Color(Enum):
    WHITE = 'white'
    BLACK = 'black'
```

**Purpose:**

- Provides a clear, type-safe way to refer to the color of a piece or the current player.
- Prevents errors that could occur from using plain strings or numbers.

**Usage Example:**

- When creating a piece: `Piece(PieceType.ROOK, Color.WHITE)`
- To check which player's turn it is: `if self.current_player == Color.BLACK: ...`

This makes the code more readable and less error-prone.

The `Piece` class represents a single chess piece on the board. Here’s a breakdown of its structure and purpose:

```python
class Piece:
    def __init__(self, piece_type: PieceType, color: Color):
        self.type = piece_type
        self.color = color
        self.has_moved = False

    def __str__(self):
        symbol = self.type.value
        return symbol.upper() if self.color == Color.WHITE else symbol.lower()

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.color.value} {self.type.value}"
```

### Attributes:

- **type:** The type of the piece (e.g., pawn, rook, queen), using the `PieceType` enum.
- **color:** The color of the piece (`Color.WHITE` or `Color.BLACK`).
- **has_moved:** A boolean flag indicating if the piece has moved (important for castling and pawn movement rules).

### Methods:

- ****init**:** Initializes the piece with its type, color, and sets `has_moved` to `False`.
- ****str**:** Returns a single-character string for the piece, uppercase for white and lowercase for black (e.g., 'P' for white pawn, 'p' for black pawn).
- ****repr**:** Returns a string representation like `"white p"` or `"black k"` for debugging and logging.

### Purpose:

This class encapsulates all the information needed for a chess piece, making it easy to manage and display pieces on the board, and to check their state during the game.

The `Move` class represents a single move in a chess game. It stores all the information needed to describe and process a move, including special moves like promotion, castling, and en passant.

```python
class Move:
    def __init__(self, from_pos: Tuple[int, int], to_pos: Tuple[int, int],
                 promotion: Optional[PieceType] = None, is_castling: bool = False,
                 is_en_passant: bool = False):
        self.from_pos = from_pos                # Starting square (row, col)
        self.to_pos = to_pos                    # Ending square (row, col)
        self.promotion = promotion              # PieceType for pawn promotion, or None
        self.is_castling = is_castling          # True if this move is castling
        self.is_en_passant = is_en_passant      # True if this move is en passant

    def __str__(self):
        # Returns a string like "e2e4" or "e7e8=Q" for promotion
        from_square = chr(ord('a') + self.from_pos[1]) + str(8 - self.from_pos[0])
        to_square = chr(ord('a') + self.to_pos[1]) + str(8 - self.to_pos[0])
        promotion_str = f"={self.promotion.value.upper()}" if self.promotion else ""
        return f"{from_square}{to_square}{promotion_str}"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        # Checks if two moves are the same (ignoring castling/en passant flags)
        if not isinstance(other, Move):
            return False
        return (self.from_pos == other.from_pos and
                self.to_pos == other.to_pos and
                self.promotion == other.promotion)
```

### Key Points:

- **from_pos / to_pos:** The move’s start and end positions as (row, col) tuples.
- **promotion:** If the move is a pawn promotion, this holds the new piece type.
- **is_castling:** True if the move is a castling move.
- **is_en_passant:** True if the move is an en passant capture.
- ****str**:** Converts the move to standard chess notation (e.g., "e2e4", "e7e8=Q").
- ****eq**:** Allows moves to be compared for equality (useful for move validation).

This class makes it easy to represent, compare, and display chess moves, including all special cases.

Here’s a function-by-function explanation of the `ChessBoard` class from your code:

---

### `__init__(self)`

Initializes the chess board and game state:

- Creates an 8x8 board filled with `None`.
- Sets the current player to white.
- Initializes move history, en passant target, halfmove clock, and fullmove number.
- Calls `setup_initial_position()` to place all pieces.

---

### `setup_initial_position(self)`

Sets up the board with the standard chess starting position:

- Places black pawns on row 1 and white pawns on row 6.
- Places other pieces (rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, rook) for both colors on their respective back ranks.

---

### `get_piece(self, row, col)`

Returns the piece at the given position if it’s on the board, otherwise returns `None`.

---

### `set_piece(self, row, col, piece)`

Sets a piece at the given position if it’s on the board.

---

### `is_valid_position(self, row, col)`

Checks if the given (row, col) is within the bounds of the board (0 to 7).

---

### `get_all_pieces(self, color)`

Returns a list of all pieces of the given color, along with their positions as `(row, col, piece)`.

---

### `find_king(self, color)`

Finds and returns the position `(row, col)` of the king of the given color. Returns `None` if not found.

---

Each of these functions helps manage the board state, access and update pieces, and set up the game for play. Let me know if you want to continue with the next set of functions!

Here’s a function-by-function explanation for the code in your selection (lines 116–172):

---

### `is_square_attacked(self, row, col, by_color)`

**Purpose:**  
Checks if a given square `(row, col)` is attacked by any piece of the specified color (`by_color`).

**How it works:**

- Iterates over all pieces of `by_color`.
- For each piece, checks if it can attack the target square using `can_piece_attack_square`.
- Returns `True` if any piece can attack the square; otherwise, returns `False`.

---

### `can_piece_attack_square(self, from_row, from_col, to_row, to_col)`

**Purpose:**  
Checks if the piece at `(from_row, from_col)` can attack the square `(to_row, to_col)`.

**How it works:**

- Gets the piece at the source square.
- Depending on the piece type, calls the appropriate helper function:
  - Pawn: `can_pawn_attack`
  - Rook: `can_rook_move`
  - Knight: `can_knight_move`
  - Bishop: `can_bishop_move`
  - Queen: Either rook or bishop move
  - King: `can_king_move`
- Returns `True` if the move is possible for that piece type.

---

### `can_pawn_attack(self, from_row, from_col, to_row, to_col, color)`

**Purpose:**  
Checks if a pawn of the given color at `(from_row, from_col)` can attack `(to_row, to_col)`.

**How it works:**

- For white, pawns attack one row up and one column left or right.
- For black, pawns attack one row down and one column left or right.
- Returns `True` if the target square is diagonally forward.

---

### `can_rook_move(self, from_row, from_col, to_row, to_col)`

**Purpose:**  
Checks if a rook can move from `(from_row, from_col)` to `(to_row, to_col)`.

**How it works:**

- Rooks move in straight lines (same row or same column).
- Calls `is_path_clear` to ensure there are no pieces in the way.
- Returns `True` if the move is valid.

---

### `can_knight_move(self, from_row, from_col, to_row, to_col)`

**Purpose:**  
Checks if a knight can move from `(from_row, from_col)` to `(to_row, to_col)`.

**How it works:**

- Knights move in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and one in the other.
- Returns `True` if the move matches the knight's movement pattern.

---

### `can_bishop_move(self, from_row, from_col, to_row, to_col)`

**Purpose:**  
Checks if a bishop can move from `(from_row, from_col)` to `(to_row, to_col)`.

**How it works:**

- Bishops move diagonally (difference in rows equals difference in columns).
- Calls `is_path_clear` to ensure the path is not blocked.
- Returns `True` if the move is valid.

---

### `can_king_move(self, from_row, from_col, to_row, to_col)`

**Purpose:**  
Checks if a king can move from `(from_row, from_col)` to `(to_row, to_col)`.

**How it works:**

- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Returns `True` if the move is to an adjacent square.
